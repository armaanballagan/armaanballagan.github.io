            <p>Hi,my name is Armaan Ballagan. I'm an eleventh grade student currently enrolled in the Computer Science co-op at Fleetwood Park. In my free time I enjoy playing video games with friends and going on walks.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Interests</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was young, I was captivated by the implementation of programming and mathematics in our everyday lives. From simple programs that run games on your phone to more complicated programs used to simulate the flight of rockets, programming has integrated itself virtually everywhere throughout the world. Alongside my interest in programming, I love to tackle challenging problems by coming up with creative solutions. Music is another area of interest and I can play the Flute proficiently.</p>

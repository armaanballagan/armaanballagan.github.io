            <p>Hello, I am Armaan Ballagan, a first year general science student at UBC. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and exercising.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Interests</h2>
            <p>My interest in Computer Science and Math stemmed from a young age when I was captivated by the implementation of programming and mathematics in our daily lives. From simple programs that run mobile games to more complicated programs used to simulate the flight of rockets, programming has integrated itself virtually everywhere throughout the world. I currently have 4 years of programming experience spread across various languages and have demonstrated these skills in the "Projects" tab on this website. If you have any inquiries, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me at armaanballagan@gmail.com or via the "Contact Me" tab</p>
